VERSIONING
----------
[major].[minor].[point]

 - Point releases for bug fixes, UI modifications, meta and build changes.

**** Bugs ***********************
- Wrap states are restored (not on stringhorse either)

**** UI *************************
- Run button
- HTML <table> view of the output

**** PROGRAMMING *************************
- string column 
  - any string is assumed to be text for the next column
  - any line starting " is treated as a string and not parsed
  - any line starting "" is the same but gets speech marks wrapped around it
- rng column
- lorem column
- date column
- 'order by' directive
- 'blank 50' on a column puts a blank value in 50% of the time
- seed 0 as a directive to set a seed so that CSVs are random/deterministic
- search for redundant elements and get rid

**** IDEAS *************************************************************
- saved recipes - it's just a JSON file into localstorage
  - import/export state - keeps recipes and variables

- commands to manage CSV files - probably CSVhorse: an app to deal only with CSV
  - move a column
  - extract a column
  - sort by a column
  - transform a column a la stringhorse
  
- JSONhorse: same idea but for JSON
