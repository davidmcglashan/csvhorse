  - any line starting "" is the same but gets speech marks wrapped around it
- rng column
- lorem column
- date column
- get rid of commands.js

**** IDEAS *************************************************************
- saved recipes - it's just a JSON file into localstorage
  - import/export state - keeps recipes and variables

- commands to manage CSV files - probably CSVhorse: an app to deal only with CSV
  - move a column
  - extract a column
  - sort by a column
  - transform a column a la stringhorse
  
- JSONhorse: same idea but for JSON
